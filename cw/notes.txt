#read the rankings into a dataframe
#order the data so that the rank of each institution is the index into the dataframe
#the columns should then be the name, location and so on
#display the dataframe

Cell2
#take all the UK institutions and make a seperate dataframe for them
#instead of their world rank, order them by national rank (the order that they appear in the world ranks), use it as index
#the columns should be in the same order as q1
#display the dataframe

Cell3
#display these values rounded to 2dp (for the uk_rankings)
#mean academic reputation
#min academic reputation
#max academic reputation
#standard deviation academic reputation
#95% confidence interval academic reputation

Cell4
#plot bar graph comparing Citations per faculty of unis only in:
#United States
#United Kingdom
#Canada
#Australia
#Netherlands
#Germany
#The horizontal axis shows the countries
#vertical axis represents mean measure of the citations per faculty
#add error bars to the graph showing the 95% confidence interval
#add title and axis labels

Cell5
#test difference between citations per faculty of unis in United States and Netherlands
#print the name of the test and results
#print one sentence stating conclusion and justification on the difference

Cell6
#find the correlation between the average pixel intensity and image quality of the images in model.zip
#average pixel intensity = average of all pixel values
#make a scatter plot
#horizontal axis for average pixel intensity
#vertical axis for image quality
#add title, axis labels
#print the Pearson linear correlation coefficient
#print one sentence on your interpretation on the strength

Cell7
#using model dataset
#build linear regression model to predict image quality (use IQ as the name of variable) from average pixel intensity (use API as the name of variable)
#make a scatter plot, horizontal axis is API, vertical is IQ, add data points from the dataset
#add the linear regression model to the plot
#add title, axis labels
#print the linear equation (rounded values to 2dp)
#print the mean squared error (the average of the squares of the errors) on the model dataset
#find the point where IQ is 5.5
#rotate the linear equation around this point by 2 degrees clockwise
#print the new linear equation
#print the new mean squared error

Cell8
evaluate the effectiveness of the linear regression model on the test dataset
create a dataframe where the first column is the image name, second is the true image quality, third is the predicted quality
print the mean squared error of the model on the test dataset
print one sentence about the effectiveness of the model by comparing the MSE on the model and the test dataset
print an improved model by adjusting the slope or intercept for the test dataset
print the MSE of the improved model on the test dataset
